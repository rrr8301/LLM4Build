      LookupError: Error getting the version from source `vcs`: setuptools-scm was unable to detect version for /app.

      However, a repository was found in a parent directory: /app

      To fix this, you have a few options:

      1. Use the 'relative_to' parameter to specify the file that setuptools-scm should use as reference:
         setuptools_scm.get_version(relative_to=__file__)

      2. Enable parent directory search in your configuration:
         [tool.setuptools_scm]
         search_parent_directories = true

      3. Change your working directory to the repository root: /app

      4. Set the root explicitly in your configuration:
         [tool.setuptools_scm]
         root = "/app"

      For more information, see: https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/
