Using Python 3.12.3 environment at: /usr
error: The interpreter at /usr is externally managed, and indicates the following:

  To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
  python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
  install.

  If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
  create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
  Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
  sure you have python3-full installed.

  If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
  it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
  virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

  See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.

hint: Virtual environments were not considered due to the `--system` flag
