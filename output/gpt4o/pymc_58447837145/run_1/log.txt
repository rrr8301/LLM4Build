critical libmamba Shell not initialized

'micromamba' is running as a subprocess and can't modify the parent shell.
Thus you must initialize your shell before using activate and deactivate.

To initialize the current  shell, run:
    $ eval "$(micromamba shell hook --shell )"
and then activate or deactivate with:
    $ micromamba activate
To automatically initialize all future () shells, run:
    $ micromamba shell init --shell  --root-prefix=~/.local/share/mamba
If your shell was already initialized, reinitialize your shell with:
    $ micromamba shell reinit --shell
Otherwise, this may be an issue. In the meantime you can run commands. See:
    $ micromamba run --help

Supported shells are {bash, zsh, csh, posix, xonsh, cmd.exe, powershell, fish, nu}.
