Applying patches...

Warning: patch-package detected a patch file version mismatch

  Don't worry! This is probably fine. The patch was still applied
  successfully. Here's the deets:

  Patch file created for

    @types/css-tree@2.3.10

  applied to

    @types/css-tree@2.3.11

  At path

    node_modules/@types/css-tree

  This warning is just to give you a heads-up. There is a small chance of
  breakage even though the patch was applied successfully. Make sure the package
  still behaves like you expect (you wrote tests, right?) and then run

    patch-package @types/css-tree

  to update the version in the patch file name and make this warning go away.
