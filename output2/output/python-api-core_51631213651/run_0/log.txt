        `Application Default Credentials`_ provides an easy way to obtain
        credentials to call Google APIs for server-to-server or local applications.
        This function acquires credentials from the environment in the following
        order:

        1. If the environment variable ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` is set
           to the path of a valid service account JSON private key file, then it is
           loaded and returned. The project ID returned is the project ID defined
           in the service account file if available (some older files do not
           contain project ID information).

           If the environment variable is set to the path of a valid external
           account JSON configuration file (workload identity federation), then the
           configuration file is used to determine and retrieve the external
           credentials from the current environment (AWS, Azure, etc).
           These will then be exchanged for Google access tokens via the Google STS
           endpoint.
           The project ID returned in this case is the one corresponding to the
           underlying workload identity pool resource if determinable.

           If the environment variable is set to the path of a valid GDCH service
           account JSON file (`Google Distributed Cloud Hosted`_), then a GDCH
           credential will be returned. The project ID returned is the project
           specified in the JSON file.
        2. If the `Google Cloud SDK`_ is installed and has application default
           credentials set they are loaded and returned.

           To enable application default credentials with the Cloud SDK run::

                gcloud auth application-default login

           If the Cloud SDK has an active project, the project ID is returned. The
           active project can be set using::

                gcloud config set project

        3. If the application is running in the `App Engine standard environment`_
           (first generation) then the credentials and project ID from the
           `App Identity Service`_ are used.
        4. If the application is running in `Compute Engine`_ or `Cloud Run`_ or
           the `App Engine flexible environment`_ or the `App Engine standard
           environment`_ (second generation) then the credentials and project ID
           are obtained from the `Metadata Service`_.
        5. If no credentials are found,
           :class:`~google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError` will be raised.

  /app/google/api_core/operations_v1/transports/base.py:105: DeprecationWarning: The `credentials_file` argument is deprecated because of a potential security risk.

  The `google.auth.load_credentials_from_file` method does not validate the credential
  configuration. The security risk occurs when a credential configuration is accepted
  from a source that is not under your control and used without validation on your side.

  If you know that you will be loading credential configurations of a
  specific type, it is recommended to use a credential-type-specific
  load method.

  This will ensure that an unexpected credential type with potential for
  malicious intent is not loaded unintentionally. You might still have to do
  validation for certain credential types. Please follow the recommendations
  for that method. For example, if you want to load only service accounts,
  you can create the service account credentials explicitly:

  ```
  from google.cloud.vision_v1 import ImageAnnotatorClient
  from google.oauth2 import service_account

  credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(filename)
  client = ImageAnnotatorClient(credentials=credentials)
  ```

  If you are loading your credential configuration from an untrusted source and have
  not mitigated the risks (e.g. by validating the configuration yourself), make
  these changes as soon as possible to prevent security risks to your environment.

  Regardless of the method used, it is always your responsibility to validate
  configurations received from external sources.

  Refer to https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/externally-sourced-credentials
  for more details.
