  /app/google/api_core/operations_v1/transports/rest.py:138: DeprecationWarning: The `credentials_file` argument is deprecated because of a potential security risk.

  The `google.auth.load_credentials_from_file` method does not validate the credential
  configuration. The security risk occurs when a credential configuration is accepted
  from a source that is not under your control and used without validation on your side.

  If you know that you will be loading credential configurations of a
  specific type, it is recommended to use a credential-type-specific
  load method.

  This will ensure that an unexpected credential type with potential for
  malicious intent is not loaded unintentionally. You might still have to do
  validation for certain credential types. Please follow the recommendations
  for that method. For example, if you want to load only service accounts,
  you can create the service account credentials explicitly:

  ```
  from google.cloud.vision_v1 import ImageAnnotatorClient
  from google.oauth2 import service_account

  credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(filename)
  client = ImageAnnotatorClient(credentials=credentials)
  ```

  If you are loading your credential configuration from an untrusted source and have
  not mitigated the risks (e.g. by validating the configuration yourself), make
  these changes as soon as possible to prevent security risks to your environment.

  Regardless of the method used, it is always your responsibility to validate
  configurations received from external sources.

  Refer to https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/externally-sourced-credentials
