        r"""
        Instantiate a pretrained pytorch model from a pre-trained model configuration.

        The model is set in evaluation mode by default using `model.eval()` (Dropout modules are deactivated). To train
        the model, you should first set it back in training mode with `model.train()`.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
                      [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
                    - A path or url to a *tensorflow index checkpoint file* (e.g, `./tf_model/model.ckpt.index`). In
                      this case, `from_tf` should be set to `True` and a configuration object should be provided as
                      `config` argument. This loading path is slower than converting the TensorFlow checkpoint in a
                      PyTorch model using the provided conversion scripts and loading the PyTorch model afterwards.
                    - A path or url to a model folder containing a *flax checkpoint file* in *.msgpack* format (e.g,
                      `./flax_model/` containing `flax_model.msgpack`). In this case, `from_flax` should be set to
                      `True`.
                    - `None` if you are both providing the configuration and state dictionary (resp. with keyword
                      arguments `config` and `state_dict`).
            model_args (sequence of positional arguments, *optional*):
                All remaining positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` method.
            config (`Union[PretrainedConfig, str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - an instance of a class derived from [`PretrainedConfig`],
                    - a string or path valid as input to [`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`].

                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuration. Configuration can
                be automatically loaded when:

                    - The model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the *model id* string of a pretrained
                      model).
                    - The model was saved using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and is reloaded by supplying the
                      save directory.
                    - The model is loaded by supplying a local directory as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and a
                      configuration JSON file named *config.json* is found in the directory.
            state_dict (`dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                A state dictionary to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.

                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own
                weights. In this case though, you should check if using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and
                [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] is not a simpler option.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            from_tf (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a TensorFlow checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            from_flax (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a Flax checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            ignore_mismatched_sizes (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to raise an error if some of the weights from the checkpoint do not have the same size
                as the weights of the model (if for instance, you are instantiating a model with 10 labels from a
                checkpoint with 3 labels).
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether ot not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.

                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>"`.

                </Tip>
            attn_implementation (`str`, *optional*):
                The attention implementation to use in the model (if relevant). Can be any of `"eager"` (manual implementation of the attention), `"sdpa"` (using [`F.scaled_dot_product_attention`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html)), `"flash_attention_2"` (using [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)), or `"flash_attention_3"` (using [Dao-AILab/flash-attention/hopper](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main/hopper)). By default, if available, SDPA will be used for torch>=2.1.1. The default is otherwise the manual `"eager"` implementation.

                Accept HF kernel references in the form:
                  <namespace>/<repo_name>[@<revision>][:<kernel_name>]

                - <namespace> and <repo_name> are any non-"/" and non-":" sequences.
                - "@<revision>" is optional (branch, tag, or commit-ish), e.g. "@main", "@v1.2.0", "@abc123".
                - ":<kernel_name>" is optional and selects a function inside the kernel repo.
                - Both options can appear together and in this order only: @revision first, then :kernel_name.
                - We intentionally allow a leading "<wrapper>|" prefix (e.g., "flash|...") because the code
                  strips it before loading; '|' is not excluded in the character classes here.

                Examples that match:
                  "org/model"
                  "org/model@main"
                  "org/model:custom_kernel"
                  "org/model@v1.2.3:custom_kernel"

            > Parameters for big model inference

            dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
                Override the default `torch_dtype` and load the model under a specific `dtype`. The different options
                are:

                1. `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16` or `torch.float`: load in a specified
                  `dtype`, ignoring the model's `config.dtype` if one exists. If not specified
                  - the model will get loaded in `torch.float` (fp32).

                2. `"auto"` - A `dtype` or `torch_dtype` entry in the `config.json` file of the model will be
                  attempted to be used. If this entry isn't found then next check the `dtype` of the first weight in
                  the checkpoint that's of a floating point type and use that as `dtype`. This will load the model
                  using the `dtype` it was saved in at the end of the training. It can't be used as an indicator of how
                  the model was trained. Since it could be trained in one of half precision dtypes, but saved in fp32.

                3. A string that is a valid `torch.dtype`. E.g. "float32" loads the model in `torch.float32`, "float16" loads in `torch.float16` etc.

                <Tip>

                For some models the `dtype` they were trained in is unknown - you may try to check the model's paper or
                reach out to the authors and ask them to add this information to the model's card and to insert the
                `dtype` or `torch_dtype` entry in `config.json` on the hub.

                </Tip>

            device_map (`str` or `dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device]]` or `int` or `torch.device`, *optional*):
                A map that specifies where each submodule should go. It doesn't need to be refined to each
                parameter/buffer name, once a given module name is inside, every submodule of it will be sent to the
                same device. If we only pass the device (*e.g.*, `"cpu"`, `"cuda:1"`, `"mps"`, or a GPU ordinal rank
                like `1`) on which the model will be allocated, the device map will map the entire model to this
                device. Passing `device_map = 0` means put the whole model on GPU 0.

                To have Accelerate compute the most optimized `device_map` automatically, set `device_map="auto"`. For
                more information about each option see [designing a device
                map](https://hf.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map).
            max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
                A dictionary device identifier to maximum memory if using `device_map`. Will default to the maximum memory available for each
                GPU and the available CPU RAM if unset.
            tp_plan (`str`, *optional*):
                A torch tensor parallel plan, see [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/TP_tutorial.html). Currently, it only accepts
                `tp_plan="auto"` to use predefined plan based on the model. Note that if you use it, you should launch your script accordingly with
                `torchrun [args] script.py`. This will be much faster than using a `device_map`, but has limitations.
            tp_size (`str`, *optional*):
                A torch tensor parallel degree. If not provided would default to world size.
            device_mesh (`torch.distributed.DeviceMesh`, *optional*):
                A torch device mesh. If not provided would default to world size. Used only for tensor parallel for now.
                If provided, it has to contain dimension named `"tp"` in case it's > 1 dimensional, this dimension will be used for tensor parallelism
            offload_folder (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                If the `device_map` contains any value `"disk"`, the folder where we will offload weights.
            offload_buffers (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to offload the buffers with the model parameters.
            quantization_config (`Union[QuantizationConfigMixin,Dict]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of configuration parameters or a QuantizationConfigMixin object for quantization (e.g
                bitsandbytes, gptq). There may be other quantization-related kwargs, including `load_in_4bit` and
                `load_in_8bit`, which are parsed by QuantizationConfigParser. Supported only for bitsandbytes
                quantizations and not preferred. consider inserting all such arguments into quantization_config
                instead.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            variant (`str`, *optional*):
                If specified load weights from `variant` filename, *e.g.* pytorch_model.<variant>.bin. `variant` is
                ignored when using `from_tf` or `from_flax`.
            use_safetensors (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
                Whether or not to use `safetensors` checkpoints. Defaults to `None`. If not specified and `safetensors`
                is not installed, it will be set to `False`.
            weights_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Indicates whether unpickler should be restricted to loading only tensors, primitive types,
                dictionaries and any types added via torch.serialization.add_safe_globals().
                When set to False, we can load wrapper tensor subclass weights.
            key_mapping (`dict[str, str], *optional*):
                A potential mapping of the weight names if using a model on the Hub which is compatible to a Transformers
                architecture, but was not converted accordingly.
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model (e.g.,
                `output_attentions=True`). Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or
                automatically loaded:

                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]). Each key of `kwargs` that
                      corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the
                      supplied `kwargs` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute
                      will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` function.

        r"""
        Instantiate a pretrained pytorch model from a pre-trained model configuration.

        The model is set in evaluation mode by default using `model.eval()` (Dropout modules are deactivated). To train
        the model, you should first set it back in training mode with `model.train()`.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
                      [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
                    - A path or url to a *tensorflow index checkpoint file* (e.g, `./tf_model/model.ckpt.index`). In
                      this case, `from_tf` should be set to `True` and a configuration object should be provided as
                      `config` argument. This loading path is slower than converting the TensorFlow checkpoint in a
                      PyTorch model using the provided conversion scripts and loading the PyTorch model afterwards.
                    - A path or url to a model folder containing a *flax checkpoint file* in *.msgpack* format (e.g,
                      `./flax_model/` containing `flax_model.msgpack`). In this case, `from_flax` should be set to
                      `True`.
                    - `None` if you are both providing the configuration and state dictionary (resp. with keyword
                      arguments `config` and `state_dict`).
            model_args (sequence of positional arguments, *optional*):
                All remaining positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` method.
            config (`Union[PretrainedConfig, str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - an instance of a class derived from [`PretrainedConfig`],
                    - a string or path valid as input to [`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`].

                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuration. Configuration can
                be automatically loaded when:

                    - The model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the *model id* string of a pretrained
                      model).
                    - The model was saved using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and is reloaded by supplying the
                      save directory.
                    - The model is loaded by supplying a local directory as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and a
                      configuration JSON file named *config.json* is found in the directory.
            state_dict (`dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                A state dictionary to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.

                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own
                weights. In this case though, you should check if using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and
                [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] is not a simpler option.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            from_tf (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a TensorFlow checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            from_flax (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a Flax checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            ignore_mismatched_sizes (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to raise an error if some of the weights from the checkpoint do not have the same size
                as the weights of the model (if for instance, you are instantiating a model with 10 labels from a
                checkpoint with 3 labels).
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether ot not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.

                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>"`.

                </Tip>
            attn_implementation (`str`, *optional*):
                The attention implementation to use in the model (if relevant). Can be any of `"eager"` (manual implementation of the attention), `"sdpa"` (using [`F.scaled_dot_product_attention`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html)), `"flash_attention_2"` (using [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)), or `"flash_attention_3"` (using [Dao-AILab/flash-attention/hopper](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main/hopper)). By default, if available, SDPA will be used for torch>=2.1.1. The default is otherwise the manual `"eager"` implementation.

                Accept HF kernel references in the form:
                  <namespace>/<repo_name>[@<revision>][:<kernel_name>]

                - <namespace> and <repo_name> are any non-"/" and non-":" sequences.
                - "@<revision>" is optional (branch, tag, or commit-ish), e.g. "@main", "@v1.2.0", "@abc123".
                - ":<kernel_name>" is optional and selects a function inside the kernel repo.
                - Both options can appear together and in this order only: @revision first, then :kernel_name.
                - We intentionally allow a leading "<wrapper>|" prefix (e.g., "flash|...") because the code
                  strips it before loading; '|' is not excluded in the character classes here.

                Examples that match:
                  "org/model"
                  "org/model@main"
                  "org/model:custom_kernel"
                  "org/model@v1.2.3:custom_kernel"

            > Parameters for big model inference

            dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
                Override the default `torch_dtype` and load the model under a specific `dtype`. The different options
                are:

                1. `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16` or `torch.float`: load in a specified
                  `dtype`, ignoring the model's `config.dtype` if one exists. If not specified
                  - the model will get loaded in `torch.float` (fp32).

                2. `"auto"` - A `dtype` or `torch_dtype` entry in the `config.json` file of the model will be
                  attempted to be used. If this entry isn't found then next check the `dtype` of the first weight in
                  the checkpoint that's of a floating point type and use that as `dtype`. This will load the model
                  using the `dtype` it was saved in at the end of the training. It can't be used as an indicator of how
                  the model was trained. Since it could be trained in one of half precision dtypes, but saved in fp32.

                3. A string that is a valid `torch.dtype`. E.g. "float32" loads the model in `torch.float32`, "float16" loads in `torch.float16` etc.

                <Tip>

                For some models the `dtype` they were trained in is unknown - you may try to check the model's paper or
                reach out to the authors and ask them to add this information to the model's card and to insert the
                `dtype` or `torch_dtype` entry in `config.json` on the hub.

                </Tip>

            device_map (`str` or `dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device]]` or `int` or `torch.device`, *optional*):
                A map that specifies where each submodule should go. It doesn't need to be refined to each
                parameter/buffer name, once a given module name is inside, every submodule of it will be sent to the
                same device. If we only pass the device (*e.g.*, `"cpu"`, `"cuda:1"`, `"mps"`, or a GPU ordinal rank
                like `1`) on which the model will be allocated, the device map will map the entire model to this
                device. Passing `device_map = 0` means put the whole model on GPU 0.

                To have Accelerate compute the most optimized `device_map` automatically, set `device_map="auto"`. For
                more information about each option see [designing a device
                map](https://hf.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map).
            max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
                A dictionary device identifier to maximum memory if using `device_map`. Will default to the maximum memory available for each
                GPU and the available CPU RAM if unset.
            tp_plan (`str`, *optional*):
                A torch tensor parallel plan, see [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/TP_tutorial.html). Currently, it only accepts
                `tp_plan="auto"` to use predefined plan based on the model. Note that if you use it, you should launch your script accordingly with
                `torchrun [args] script.py`. This will be much faster than using a `device_map`, but has limitations.
            tp_size (`str`, *optional*):
                A torch tensor parallel degree. If not provided would default to world size.
            device_mesh (`torch.distributed.DeviceMesh`, *optional*):
                A torch device mesh. If not provided would default to world size. Used only for tensor parallel for now.
                If provided, it has to contain dimension named `"tp"` in case it's > 1 dimensional, this dimension will be used for tensor parallelism
            offload_folder (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                If the `device_map` contains any value `"disk"`, the folder where we will offload weights.
            offload_buffers (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to offload the buffers with the model parameters.
            quantization_config (`Union[QuantizationConfigMixin,Dict]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of configuration parameters or a QuantizationConfigMixin object for quantization (e.g
                bitsandbytes, gptq). There may be other quantization-related kwargs, including `load_in_4bit` and
                `load_in_8bit`, which are parsed by QuantizationConfigParser. Supported only for bitsandbytes
                quantizations and not preferred. consider inserting all such arguments into quantization_config
                instead.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            variant (`str`, *optional*):
                If specified load weights from `variant` filename, *e.g.* pytorch_model.<variant>.bin. `variant` is
                ignored when using `from_tf` or `from_flax`.
            use_safetensors (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
                Whether or not to use `safetensors` checkpoints. Defaults to `None`. If not specified and `safetensors`
                is not installed, it will be set to `False`.
            weights_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Indicates whether unpickler should be restricted to loading only tensors, primitive types,
                dictionaries and any types added via torch.serialization.add_safe_globals().
                When set to False, we can load wrapper tensor subclass weights.
            key_mapping (`dict[str, str], *optional*):
                A potential mapping of the weight names if using a model on the Hub which is compatible to a Transformers
                architecture, but was not converted accordingly.
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model (e.g.,
                `output_attentions=True`). Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or
                automatically loaded:

                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]). Each key of `kwargs` that
                      corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the
                      supplied `kwargs` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute
                      will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` function.

        r"""
        Instantiate a pretrained pytorch model from a pre-trained model configuration.

        The model is set in evaluation mode by default using `model.eval()` (Dropout modules are deactivated). To train
        the model, you should first set it back in training mode with `model.train()`.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
                      [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
                    - A path or url to a *tensorflow index checkpoint file* (e.g, `./tf_model/model.ckpt.index`). In
                      this case, `from_tf` should be set to `True` and a configuration object should be provided as
                      `config` argument. This loading path is slower than converting the TensorFlow checkpoint in a
                      PyTorch model using the provided conversion scripts and loading the PyTorch model afterwards.
                    - A path or url to a model folder containing a *flax checkpoint file* in *.msgpack* format (e.g,
                      `./flax_model/` containing `flax_model.msgpack`). In this case, `from_flax` should be set to
                      `True`.
                    - `None` if you are both providing the configuration and state dictionary (resp. with keyword
                      arguments `config` and `state_dict`).
            model_args (sequence of positional arguments, *optional*):
                All remaining positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` method.
            config (`Union[PretrainedConfig, str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - an instance of a class derived from [`PretrainedConfig`],
                    - a string or path valid as input to [`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`].

                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuration. Configuration can
                be automatically loaded when:

                    - The model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the *model id* string of a pretrained
                      model).
                    - The model was saved using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and is reloaded by supplying the
                      save directory.
                    - The model is loaded by supplying a local directory as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and a
                      configuration JSON file named *config.json* is found in the directory.
            state_dict (`dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                A state dictionary to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.

                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own
                weights. In this case though, you should check if using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and
                [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] is not a simpler option.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            from_tf (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a TensorFlow checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            from_flax (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a Flax checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            ignore_mismatched_sizes (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to raise an error if some of the weights from the checkpoint do not have the same size
                as the weights of the model (if for instance, you are instantiating a model with 10 labels from a
                checkpoint with 3 labels).
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether ot not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.

                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>"`.

                </Tip>
            attn_implementation (`str`, *optional*):
                The attention implementation to use in the model (if relevant). Can be any of `"eager"` (manual implementation of the attention), `"sdpa"` (using [`F.scaled_dot_product_attention`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html)), `"flash_attention_2"` (using [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)), or `"flash_attention_3"` (using [Dao-AILab/flash-attention/hopper](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main/hopper)). By default, if available, SDPA will be used for torch>=2.1.1. The default is otherwise the manual `"eager"` implementation.

                Accept HF kernel references in the form:
                  <namespace>/<repo_name>[@<revision>][:<kernel_name>]

                - <namespace> and <repo_name> are any non-"/" and non-":" sequences.
                - "@<revision>" is optional (branch, tag, or commit-ish), e.g. "@main", "@v1.2.0", "@abc123".
                - ":<kernel_name>" is optional and selects a function inside the kernel repo.
                - Both options can appear together and in this order only: @revision first, then :kernel_name.
                - We intentionally allow a leading "<wrapper>|" prefix (e.g., "flash|...") because the code
                  strips it before loading; '|' is not excluded in the character classes here.

                Examples that match:
                  "org/model"
                  "org/model@main"
                  "org/model:custom_kernel"
                  "org/model@v1.2.3:custom_kernel"

            > Parameters for big model inference

            dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
                Override the default `torch_dtype` and load the model under a specific `dtype`. The different options
                are:

                1. `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16` or `torch.float`: load in a specified
                  `dtype`, ignoring the model's `config.dtype` if one exists. If not specified
                  - the model will get loaded in `torch.float` (fp32).

                2. `"auto"` - A `dtype` or `torch_dtype` entry in the `config.json` file of the model will be
                  attempted to be used. If this entry isn't found then next check the `dtype` of the first weight in
                  the checkpoint that's of a floating point type and use that as `dtype`. This will load the model
                  using the `dtype` it was saved in at the end of the training. It can't be used as an indicator of how
                  the model was trained. Since it could be trained in one of half precision dtypes, but saved in fp32.

                3. A string that is a valid `torch.dtype`. E.g. "float32" loads the model in `torch.float32`, "float16" loads in `torch.float16` etc.

                <Tip>

                For some models the `dtype` they were trained in is unknown - you may try to check the model's paper or
                reach out to the authors and ask them to add this information to the model's card and to insert the
                `dtype` or `torch_dtype` entry in `config.json` on the hub.

                </Tip>

            device_map (`str` or `dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device]]` or `int` or `torch.device`, *optional*):
                A map that specifies where each submodule should go. It doesn't need to be refined to each
                parameter/buffer name, once a given module name is inside, every submodule of it will be sent to the
                same device. If we only pass the device (*e.g.*, `"cpu"`, `"cuda:1"`, `"mps"`, or a GPU ordinal rank
                like `1`) on which the model will be allocated, the device map will map the entire model to this
                device. Passing `device_map = 0` means put the whole model on GPU 0.

                To have Accelerate compute the most optimized `device_map` automatically, set `device_map="auto"`. For
                more information about each option see [designing a device
                map](https://hf.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map).
            max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
                A dictionary device identifier to maximum memory if using `device_map`. Will default to the maximum memory available for each
                GPU and the available CPU RAM if unset.
            tp_plan (`str`, *optional*):
                A torch tensor parallel plan, see [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/TP_tutorial.html). Currently, it only accepts
                `tp_plan="auto"` to use predefined plan based on the model. Note that if you use it, you should launch your script accordingly with
                `torchrun [args] script.py`. This will be much faster than using a `device_map`, but has limitations.
            tp_size (`str`, *optional*):
                A torch tensor parallel degree. If not provided would default to world size.
            device_mesh (`torch.distributed.DeviceMesh`, *optional*):
                A torch device mesh. If not provided would default to world size. Used only for tensor parallel for now.
                If provided, it has to contain dimension named `"tp"` in case it's > 1 dimensional, this dimension will be used for tensor parallelism
            offload_folder (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                If the `device_map` contains any value `"disk"`, the folder where we will offload weights.
            offload_buffers (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to offload the buffers with the model parameters.
            quantization_config (`Union[QuantizationConfigMixin,Dict]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of configuration parameters or a QuantizationConfigMixin object for quantization (e.g
                bitsandbytes, gptq). There may be other quantization-related kwargs, including `load_in_4bit` and
                `load_in_8bit`, which are parsed by QuantizationConfigParser. Supported only for bitsandbytes
                quantizations and not preferred. consider inserting all such arguments into quantization_config
                instead.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            variant (`str`, *optional*):
                If specified load weights from `variant` filename, *e.g.* pytorch_model.<variant>.bin. `variant` is
                ignored when using `from_tf` or `from_flax`.
            use_safetensors (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
                Whether or not to use `safetensors` checkpoints. Defaults to `None`. If not specified and `safetensors`
                is not installed, it will be set to `False`.
            weights_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Indicates whether unpickler should be restricted to loading only tensors, primitive types,
                dictionaries and any types added via torch.serialization.add_safe_globals().
                When set to False, we can load wrapper tensor subclass weights.
            key_mapping (`dict[str, str], *optional*):
                A potential mapping of the weight names if using a model on the Hub which is compatible to a Transformers
                architecture, but was not converted accordingly.
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model (e.g.,
                `output_attentions=True`). Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or
                automatically loaded:

                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]). Each key of `kwargs` that
                      corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the
                      supplied `kwargs` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute
                      will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` function.
